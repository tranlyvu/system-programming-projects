    - Replicated each key on 3 consecutive nodes with both read and write quorum number of 2 to improve fault tolerance.
    - Implemented stabilization protocol on load-balancing consistent hashing ring to recreate 3 replicas after failure.
    - Implemented membership protocol for failure detection in distributed systems running on an emulated P2P network that satisfied Completeness (each failure is detected) and Eventual Accuracy (there is no mistaken detection) in the lossy network with all-to-all heartbeat mechanism - each process periodically sends out heartbeats to all the other processes.
